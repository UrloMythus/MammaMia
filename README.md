## Hugging Face

  

  

  

To host this project with Hugging Face you will need a Github Account, a Hugging Face account and a  [TMDB KEY](https://www.educative.io/courses/movie-database-api-python/set-up-the-credentials).

  

  

  

  

1. Fork this project and give it  a random name. 

[!WARNING] The name must not be related to Mamma Mia or mediaflowproxy. Just use a random name 

2. Go on the Github of the [Repo](https://github.com/UrloMythus/MammaMia/), click on Fork -> Create New Fork -> Create One. 

3. Click on static directory and then click on static.py. Remove the whole content and put:
```
HTML = """
Whatever you want
"""
```
4. Change ```Whatever you want``` with a random phrase (the longer it is, the better it is). If you are too lazy go to this [link](https://www.thewordfinder.com/random-sentence-generator/) and generate it.
 
5. Click Commit Changes
[!WARNING] Since the main page doesn't exist  anymore, you will need to configure MammaMia from /configure endpoint


6. Go to [linked](https://huggingface.co/login?next=%2Fnew-space) page and create a new Public Docker Space.
[!WARNING] The Space must be Public or else you won't be able to access it 


7. Go to Settings and in ```Variables and secrets``` section click New Secret. As ```Name```  put TMDB_KEY and as ```Value`` put your TMDB Key

8. Go to Files  and click Contribute -> Create a new file 
 
9. In ```Name your file``` field put ```Dockerfile``` . Inside the text box put the content of the Dockerfile called ```Dockerfile-auto-update-no-config``` which you will find inside the /Dockerfiles directory of your Github Fork. 

10. Where there is "YourUsername" put your Github username and where there is "YourRepoName" insert the name of the fork. 
[!WARNING] Don't remove the final . or it won't work

11. When you are done click Commit Changes to main

12. Go to the README.md in the Files section of your HuggingFace's space and click on it. After that click on edit. After ```pinned: false``` insert this  ```app_port: 8080```

13. When you are done click Commit Changes to main

14. You are done!


  

15. To install it on Stremio  you will need the Direct URL. It can be found on three dots --> Embed This Space --> Direct URL      
   If you do not find it it means your space is Private. To fix so go to Settings and click Set Visibility to Public. 

 
  

 
16. How to handle updates: First of all you will need to go to your GitHub Repo and click Sync Changes (without discarding commits). Then go into your HuggingFace Space ---> Settings ---> Factory Reset
  

  

  

## Render



  

  

To install this project on [Render](https://render.com/) follow these steps:

  

  

  

1. Create an Account

  

  

  

2. Create a Web Service

  

  

  

3. Fork the repo and then connect it to Render

  

  

  

4. Aside from usual enviroment variables you will need to put PORT = 8080. 

  

  

  

5. As build command put `` pip install -r requirements `` and as run command put ``python3 run.py ``

  

  

  

6. Then just finish Render Setup and you are done :)

  

  

Remember, load_env  needs to be disabled in the config.json
